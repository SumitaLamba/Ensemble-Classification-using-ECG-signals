**Arrhythmia Classification**
Arrhythmia Classification using Ensemble Learning models via ECG signals
**Task - At A Glance:**

A DWTFrTV based denoising and ensemble model based classification model is developed to classify arrhythmias in binary class ECG signals.

Task: Arrhythmia Classification
Input: ECG Signal 
Output: Arrhythmia Class - 2 Classes (Normal, Abnormal)
Preprocessing: (i) Wavelet Denoising, (ii) Missing Data handling
Class Balancing Approach: SMOTE
Classification: Ensemble models (Base (PNN, RFoSA and ELMoRNN) and Meta Learner (Linear Regression))
